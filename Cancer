    "## Disease Background:\n",
    "*Pick a hallmark to focus on, and figure out what genes you are interested in researching based on that decision. Then fill out the information below.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cancer hallmark focus:\n",
    "* Overview of hallmark:\n",
    "* Genes associated with hallmark to be studied (describe the role of each gene, signaling pathway, or gene set you are going to investigate):\n",
    "\n",
    "*Will you be focusing on a single cancer type or looking across cancer types? Depending on your decision, update this section to include relevant information about the disease at the appropriate level of detail. Regardless, each bullet point should be filled in. If you are looking at multiple cancer types, you should investigate differences between the types (e.g. what is the most prevalent cancer type? What type has the highest mortality rate?) and similarities (e.g. what sorts of treatments exist across the board for cancer patients? what is common to all cancers in terms of biological mechanisms?). Note that this is a smaller list than the initial 11 in Module 1.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence\n",
    "- Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, with over 2.3 million new cases annually and accounting for nearly one in four female cancer diagnoses.\n",
    "- In the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women (about 13%) will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime.\n",
    "- Incidence rates are highest in developed countries, partially due to lifestyle factors and increased screening.\n",
    "- Despite advances in early detection, metastatic breast cancer remains incurable and responsible for about 42,000 deaths each year in the U.S. alone. The survival rate drops dramatically once the cancer spreads beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle) & Societal determinants\n",
    "- Genetic factors: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most well-known genetic contributors, significantly raising the lifetime risk. Other genes like TP53, PTEN, CHEK2, and HER2 amplifications also influence tumor development and aggressiveness.\n",
    "- Lifestyle factors: A high-fat diet, alcohol intake, obesity, prolonged hormone replacement therapy, and lack of physical activity increase risk. Early menstruation, late menopause, and nulliparity also contribute due to prolonged estrogen exposure.\n",
    "- Societal determinants: Socioeconomic barriers, healthcare access, and racial disparities play a major role in outcomes. Black women, for instance, are more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype, and have higher mortality rates.\n",
    "- Environmental exposures—such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals—are emerging as possible contributors to breast cancer risk.\n",

    "* Standard of care treatments (& reimbursement) \n",
    "- Localized and early-stage disease: Surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) followed by radiation therapy remains the standard approach to remove and control localized tumors.\n",
    "- Systemic therapies: Include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive cancers (e.g., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), and targeted therapies for HER2-positive subtypes (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab).\n",
    "- Anti-angiogenic therapy: Drugs like Bevacizumab (Avastin) target VEGF signaling to inhibit new blood vessel growth. However, their effectiveness in breast cancer has been debated due to limited improvement in overall survival and significant side effects such as hypertension and clotting risks.\n",
    "- Reimbursement: Most standard treatments are covered by private and public insurance in the U.S., but access can vary globally. Cost and insurance disparities can limit the availability of advanced targeted therapies and clinical trial participation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology)\n",
    "- Anatomy & organ physiology: The breast is composed of lobules (milk-producing glands) and ducts (milk-carrying channels), surrounded by fatty and connective tissue. Cancer often originates in ductal or lobular epithelial cells, where mutations drive uncontrolled proliferation.\n",
    "- Cell & molecular physiology: In hypoxic (low-oxygen) tumor regions, cells stabilize HIF-1α, which upregulates VEGF and FGF, stimulating endothelial cells to form new blood vessels.\n",
    "These new tumor vessels are often disorganized, leaky, and inefficient, leading to uneven oxygen distribution and facilitating metastasis by allowing tumor cells to enter circulation.\n",
    "- FGF and VEGF signaling pathways also interact, creating redundancy in angiogenic signaling, which can make tumors resistant to single-agent anti-angiogenic drugs.\n",
    "- This aberrant angiogenesis not only supports tumor growth but also contributes to the tumor’s ability to evade immune surveillance and develop drug resistance.\n",
