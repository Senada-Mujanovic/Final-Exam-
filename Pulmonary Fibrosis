    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence\n",
    "    - Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease that leads to scarring (fibrosis) of the lung tissue. The global prevalence is estimated to be between 13–20 cases per 100,000 people, with higher rates in industrialized countries. In the United States, PF affects roughly 100,000–200,000 people, and about 30,000–40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.\n",
    "    - The disease predominantly affects men over the age of 50, with the risk increasing significantly with age. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)—the most common and severe subtype—has an annual incidence of 10–20 cases per 100,000 individuals and a median survival rate of 3–5 years after diagnosis.\n",
    "    - Studies suggest that the incidence is rising, partly due to improved detection through high-resolution CT imaging and greater awareness of interstitial lung diseases.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle)\n",
    "    - Genetic factors: Approximately 5–20% of pulmonary fibrosis cases are familial, indicating a strong hereditary component. Mutations in telomerase-related genes (TERT, TERC) shorten telomeres and impair cell repair, predisposing individuals to lung fibrosis. Additionally, mutations in surfactant protein genes (SFTPC, SFTPA2) disrupt alveolar stability and increase fibrosis risk. The MUC5B promoter variant is the most significant genetic risk factor identified to date—it increases the likelihood of developing IPF by several fold and may influence disease progression.\n",
    "    - Lifestyle and environmental factors: Prolonged cigarette smoking is the most consistent lifestyle risk factor and is linked to earlier disease onset and faster progression. Chronic exposure to occupational dusts and fibers (silica, asbestos, metal, and coal dust) also increases risk, as does exposure to environmental pollutants and toxic fumes. Certain medications, such as amiodarone, bleomycin, and methotrexate, can induce drug-related pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic viral infections (Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis C, herpesviruses) and gastroesophageal reflux–related microaspiration have also been proposed as contributing factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Symptoms\n",
    "    - The early clinical presentation of pulmonary fibrosis is often insidious, making diagnosis challenging. The two hallmark symptoms are progressive exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) and a persistent, dry, non-productive cough that worsens over time.\n",
    "    - As the disease advances, patients may develop fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and digital clubbing (widening of the fingertips). On physical examination, doctors may hear distinctive “Velcro-like” crackles at the lung bases during inspiration.\n",
    "    - n late stages, cyanosis (bluish skin tone) due to hypoxemia and swelling of the ankles and legs from pulmonary hypertension can occur. Recurrent respiratory infections are also common as lung function deteriorates.\n",

    "The data set consists of images of mice lungs that were analyzed in my professor’s lab. These mice were experimentally induced with pulmonary fibrosis, and the images capture the resulting tissue changes. In the images, areas affected by the disease appear as white specks, while healthy lung tissue is represented in black.\n",
    "For our analysis, we selected all 78 images out of a total of 78 available pictures. The images were chosen to represent typical cases of disease distribution while avoiding extreme outliers, although one outlier was noted where white regions appeared around blood vessels. This is atypical, as pulmonary fibrosis generally manifests in lung tissue, and the white areas near vessels may reflect imaging artifacts or localized anomalies rather than true disease spread.\n",
    "The data was collected using imaging techniques in the lab, likely involving microscopy and staining methods to highlight fibrotic regions. Units of measurement are pixel-based for the images, with intensity representing disease presence (white = diseased, black = healthy). This subset of images allows for a detailed analysis of disease distribution and identification of patterns or anomalies in pulmonary fibrosis progression."

    "\n",
    "From our analysis, we can conclude that pulmonary fibrosis does not affect lung tissue uniformly. The project data, which includes images from different depths, clearly shows that the extent of fibrosis—measured by the percentage of white pixels—varies depending on how deep the image was taken into the lung. By using interpolation, we can also conclude that there's a predictable relationship between depth and the amount of fibrotic tissue. This allows us to estimate the degree of fibrosis at depths where we didn't take an image, confirming that the disease follows a definable pattern of progression. Essentially, we've demonstrated that the spatial distribution of fibrosis is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion that pulmonary fibrosis develops unevenly across different depths of the lung carries important ethical implications. It reinforces the value of animal research in understanding complex diseases while also reminding us of the moral responsibility that comes with it. Although the study used only one mouse, inducing fibrosis still involves harm, so such work must always be justified by meaningful scientific outcomes and conducted under strict ethical oversight. I believe this research was carried out responsibly and in accordance with humane standards. Ethically, it is also important to interpret and present the findings with integrity—avoiding exaggeration of results and acknowledging limitations in scope. Finally, the conclusions highlight a duty to ensure that the knowledge gained from this study is used for beneficial purposes, such as improving treatment and prevention of pulmonary fibrosis, thereby giving purpose and value to the animal’s contribution to science. \n"

    "## Limitations and Future Work: \n",
    "*(Think about the answer your analysis generated, draw conclusions related to your overarching question, and discuss the ethical implications of your conclusions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the fibrotic mouse lungs has some notable limitations, mainly stemming from the data itself and the methods used. The image analysis is based on a simplified binary system of \"white\" for disease and \"black\" for healthy tissue, which oversimplifies the complex and varied nature of fibrosis. This approach can't distinguish between mild and severe scarring and may misinterpret imaging artifacts, such as the unusual white specks near blood vessels, as actual disease. Furthermore, the dataset is quite small, consisting of only 78 images from a single experimental group, which restricts the statistical power and makes it difficult to draw broad conclusions. A significant limitation is the lack of a healthy control group, which prevents us from establishing a normal baseline for comparison. Finally, the analysis is disconnected from crucial biological context; without information like the mice's age, sex, or disease progression over time, we cannot correlate our findings with key biological variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this research, future work should focus on expanding the scope and refining the analytical methods. A crucial next step is to include a healthy control group to provide a reliable baseline for the extent of fibrosis. We also need to move beyond simple pixel counting and adopt more sophisticated image analysis techniques, such as machine learning, to better identify and quantify different levels of scarring and to filter out potential artifacts. By doing this, we can move from just describing the disease to understanding its true progression. Ultimately, the goal is to integrate our imaging data with other biological information—like gene expression, clinical measurements, and the mice's health records—to build a more comprehensive and meaningful picture of pulmonary fibrosis. This would allow us to analyze not only how fibrosis varies with depth but also how it is influenced by other biological factors."
