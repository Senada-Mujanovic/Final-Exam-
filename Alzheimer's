    "Our analysis shows that while there were observable differences in pTau levels between Alzheimer’s patients and control patients, the t-test did not find these differences to be statistically significant. This means we cannot conclude that elevated pTau alone is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. However, the scatter plots and regression analyses highlight a relationship between pTau and Aβ42 within the Alzheimer’s group, reinforcing the idea that these biomarkers may play a role in disease pathology. These findings align with the broader understanding of Alzheimer’s as a protein-accumulation disorder and suggest that pTau and Aβ42 together may still be useful in distinguishing affected patients from controls, even if pTau alone does not provide a definitive marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an ethical standpoint, this research involves sensitive patient data, so maintaining privacy and confidentiality remains essential. Care must also be taken in interpreting and communicating these findings: biomarker differences on their own cannot serve as a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s without additional context. Researchers and clinicians should present results responsibly, avoiding overstated claims that could mislead patient care or cause undue concern. By emphasizing both the potential and the limitations of biomarker-based studies, we support a more ethical and cautious approach to advancing Alzheimer’s research."

    "There re several limitations to our analysis. The sample size may not fully represet the general population, and missing or zero values in pTau or AB42 could affect the accuracy of reults. Additionally, the dataset is cross-sectional, providing only a snapshot rather than capturing disease progression over time, which limits insights into how these biomakrers change during the course of Alzheimer's diesease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could focus on ecpanding the dataset and including longitudinal measurments to track biomarkers dynamics. Incorporating additional biomarkers, genetic information, and more advanced statistical or machine learning models may improve diesease prediction and understanding. THroughout future research, ethical standards must remain a priority, particularly in handling pateint data and in communicating results responsibly to both rhe scientific community and public. \n"
